# Angular2TypeScriptWebpack
This is angular 2 application with typescript and webpack with build, serve and prod

To work on this project:

* Run `npm install` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run serve` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
* Run `npm run build` to bundle everything into the `dist` folder for deployment.
* Run `npm run build:prod` to do the same as above but enabling optimisations for production.

* [bootstrap](https://github.com/mirkonasato/angular2-course-webpack-starter/tree/bootstrap): includes the Bootstrap CSS framework.
